# Basedecoder
This is a Base (binary data as printable text) decoder to crack Base Encryption (Base2, Base13, Base16) which is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) string format. This scheme is designed to carry data stored in binary format across channels, and takes any form of data and converts it to a long string of plain text. To use this tool, simply download and run the python script, then select the Base type decoder option and enter the cipher text.
